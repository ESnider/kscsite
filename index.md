aboutMe:
  color: light
  text: >-
    I have deep experience in the Bay Area, San Jose, and Silicon Valley in real
    estate development, land use, government relations, and entitlements. My
    specialty is forward planning, project and program management, and site
    design. My experience in city planning, infill redevelopment, and many years
    as a private developer gives me a unique perspective from both sides of the
    table, and has informed all my work on behalf of developers and property
    owners. 


    I am an excellent team-builder and manager with years of experience
    overseeing complex planning and entitlement processes in many jurisdictions.
    I have achieved a high success rate in designing, managing, and constructing
    projects by holding tight to the non-negotiables _(honestly, just
    recognizing the non-negotiables puts me ahead of most people in the room)_
    while facilitating sensitive, genuine cooperation with key stakeholders.
