**Brent Lower**
Executive Vice President at Washington Real Estate Holdings, LLC

> Kelly was instrumental in helping our firm navigate the entitlement process within the City of Santa Clara for our Mission Park Market Place project, a 23,000 SF amenity retail center and a 175 key Element by Westin hotel. On top of that, she was fun to work with! I would highly recommend Kelly.

**Kelly Kline**
Economic Development Director / Chief Innovation Officer

> Kelly is a smart, creative and hard-working real estate professional with a unique perspective given her experience in both the public and private sectors. She particularly shines in complex, mixed use settings where her expertise with retail, housing and office products can be harnessed. Kelly has far-reaching relationships with brokers, tenants, planners and developers as well as amazing technical savvy.

**John G. Ellis, AIA**
Partner at Mithun / Solomon

> I worked for Kelly when she was with Toll Brothers on a large scale mixed-use project in Mountain View. She was an excellent manager, focused and creative and displayed great skills in dealing with the local community and their concerns. She brought in supportive interest groups such as TALC and the Bicycle Coalition who all helped win the entitlements on the project.

**Maribel Castillo**
Leader in Strategic Marketing and Global Communications in the A/E/C Industry

> Kelly is smart, sexy, and funny, oh wait, thatâ€™s Tina Fey. Seriously, Kelly is that rare combination of intelligence, charm, and wit. On top of that, she always does fantastic work, and gets the job done, right. I highly recommend Kelly!

**Reed Moulds**
Managing Director at Sand Hill Property Company

> Kelly has a great background in RE development and is as sharp as they come. She led our residential development efforts at the Sunnyvale Town Center and had the component positioned for success but for the market. Suffice it to say she was productive in her post at Sand Hill in an otherwise very unproductive time for our industry. I am confident she will tackle and succeed in her next pursuit with skill, assiduity, and good humor! She is a motivating presence with leadership ability, and I enjoyed working with her.
