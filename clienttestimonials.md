**Brent Lower**
Executive Vice President at Washington Real Estate Holdings, LLC

> Kelly was instrumental in helping our firm navigate the entitlement process within the City of Santa Clara for our Mission Park Market Place project, a 23,000 SF amenity retail center and a 175 key Element by Westin hotel. On top of that, she was fun to work with! I would highly recommend Kelly.

**Kelly Kline**
Economic Development Director / Chief Innovation Officer

> Kelly is a smart, creative and hard-working real estate professional with a unique perspective given her experience in both the public and private sectors. She particularly shines in complex, mixed use settings where her expertise with retail, housing and office products can be harnessed. Kelly has far-reaching relationships with brokers, tenants, planners and developers as well as amazing technical savvy.

**Michael Crain**
Vice President Global Sales & Product Design: Passionately Implementing Skill Development Solutions for Our Clients

> I meet thousands of professionals yearly and while I have respect for the majority, few stand out as exceptional. Kelly Snider is one of those amazing few. Her ability to transform a concept into reality is outstanding. The fact that she is very well spoken and can articulate complex matters in a manner easy for all to understand is a talent worthy of emulation.

**John G. Ellis**
Partner at Mithun / Solomon

> I worked for Kelly when she was with Toll Brothers on a large scale mixed-use project in Mountain View. She was an excellent manager, focused and creative and displayed great skills in dealing with the local community and their concerns. She brought in supportive interest groups such as TALC and the Bicycle Coalition who all helped win the entitlements on the project.

**Jessica Grossman**
Experienced real estate development professional.

> Kelly is an excellent project manager. She is a dedicated professional with an in-depth understanding of all aspects of land-planning.

**Chris Remedios**
Architect, AIA

> Kelly and I worked together on a multi-family housing project and I wholeheartedly recommend her. Kelly's leadership skills were evident as she ran a large development project team fraught with disaster on every turn (aren't they all?). She is a great team player and fully invests her energy into the success of a project. She would be a great asset to any development firm looking for someone can handle difficult and complicated projects.

**Maribel Castillo**
Leader in Strategic Marketing and Global Communications in the A/E/C Industry

> Kelly is smart, sexy, and funny, oh wait, thatâ€™s Tina Fey. Seriously, Kelly is that rare combination of intelligence, charm, and wit. On top of that, she always does fantastic work, and gets the job done, right. I highly recommend Kelly!

**Reed Moulds**
Managing Director at Sand Hill Property Compan

> Kelly has a great background in RE development and is as sharp as they come. She led our residential development efforts at the Sunnyvale Town Center and had the component positioned for success but for the market. Suffice it to say she was productive in her post at Sand Hill in an otherwise very unproductive time for our industry. I am confident she will tackle and succeed in her next pursuit with skill, assiduity, and good humor! She is a motivating presence with leadership ability, and I enjoyed working with her.
